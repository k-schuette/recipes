Simple Pasta
from Lidia Bastianich

1 cup flour
--Measure into a medium bowl.

Into a glass measuring cup, combine
1/4 cup oil
1 egg
water for 3.5 oz liquid total.

Use a fork to stir liquids into flour until a soft dough
forms.

Knead the dough on a floured surface until it is smooth and
springy.

Form the dough into a ball, cover with the overturned bowl,
and let it rest for 30 min.

Bring a medium pot of salted water to boil. Warm the desired
sauce or topping for the pasta in a skillet.

Roll pasta dough out into a thin sheet. Flour generously,
then fold in thirds like a letter. Use a knife or pizza
cutter to slice into noodles of the desired width. Unfold
the noodles and toss with flour.

Drop the noodles in boiling water, giving them one stir. They
will cook quickly, in just a couple minutes. When they are
the desired texture (taste them - they will be soft),
remove the noodles from the water with a tongs or spider
and add them to the pan with the sauce/topping.

Use the tongs to turn the pasta in the sauce, then plate
and serve.
